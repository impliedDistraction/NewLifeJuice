# 🔧 Complete Supabase Setup & Issue Resolution Guide

## 🎯 **CRITICAL FIXES TO APPLY**

### **1. Fix Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Issue**

**Problem**: RLS blocking user registration due to circular dependency  
**Solution**: Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Drop existing client_users policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "client_users_access" ON client_users;

-- Create new policy that allows user registration
CREATE POLICY "client_users_access" ON client_users
    FOR ALL USING (
        -- Users can see their own record
        id = auth.uid() OR
        -- Users can see users in their client
        client_id = get_user_client_id() OR 
        -- Platform owners see all
        is_platform_owner()
    );

-- Allow INSERT for new user registration
CREATE POLICY "client_users_insert" ON client_users
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        -- User can insert their own record
        id = auth.uid() OR
        -- Platform owners can insert any record
        is_platform_owner()
    );
```

### **2. Fix Email Confirmation URL Issue**

**Problem**: Email pointing to `localhost:3000` instead of your dev server  
**Solution**: Update Supabase settings:

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/hgfbogaljsgqzgrfeqmn/auth/url-configuration
2. **Update Site URL** to: `http://localhost:4323`
3. **Add these Redirect URLs**:
   - `http://localhost:4323`
   - `http://localhost:4323/admin`
   - `http://localhost:4323/admin/dashboard` 
   - `https://newlifejuice.com` (for production)
   - `https://www.newlifejuice.com` (for production)

### **3. Create Supabase Storage Bucket**

**Problem**: Image upload will fail without storage bucket  
**Solution**: Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create the storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, allowed_mime_types, file_size_limit)
VALUES ('client-assets', 'client-assets', true, 
        ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif'], 
        10485760); -- 10MB limit

-- Set up storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for everyone" ON storage.objects
    FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'client-assets');

CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON storage.objects  
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'client-assets' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for users" ON storage.objects
    FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'client-assets' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

### **4. ✅ Verify Client Files Table**

**Status**: ✅ Table already exists!  
**Solution**: Just verify RLS policy exists:

```sql
-- Verify client_files table and add RLS policy if needed
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Only create the policy if it doesn't exist
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE tablename = 'client_files' 
        AND policyname = 'client_files_access'
    ) THEN
        CREATE POLICY "client_files_access" ON client_files
            FOR ALL USING (
                client_id = get_user_client_id() OR is_platform_owner()
            );
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE client_files ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
