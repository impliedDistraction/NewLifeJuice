## 💡 Immediate Actions You Can Take

### **For Better Image Management:**
1. **Create dedicated folders** for each season in your `images/` directory:
   ```
   images/
   ├── spring-2025/
   ├── summer-2025/
   ├── fall-2025/
   ├── winter-2025/
   └── year-round/
   ```

2. **Use descriptive naming**:
   ```
   spring-detox-green.jpg
   summer-tropical-paradise.jpg
   fall-spiced-apple-cider.jpg
   ```

3. **Optimize before upload**:
   - Use [TinyPNG.com](https://tinypng.com) to compress images
   - Resize to exactly 400x300px for products
   - Save as JPG for photos, PNG for graphics

### **For Seasonal Management:**
1. **Create seasonal config backups**:
   - Save each season's `config.json` as `config-spring-2025.json`
   - Easy to restore previous menus

2. **Use the active/inactive toggle** strategically:
   - Keep seasonal products in config but set `active: false`
   - Quick to reactivate when season returns

## 🔧 Technical Recommendations

### **Image Storage Strategy:**
1. **Small Business (< 50 products)**: GitHub + manual optimization
2. **Growing Business (50+ products)**: Cloudinary + automated workflow  
3. **Enterprise (100+ products)**: Custom CMS solution

### **Update Frequency Optimization:**
- **Daily updates**: Use admin panel with GitHub integration
- **Weekly batches**: Direct GitHub editing
- **Seasonal overhauls**: Template system (coming soon)

### **Mobile Optimization:**
- All image solutions include responsive delivery
- Test on mobile devices after image changes
- Consider vertical/square images for mobile Instagram integration
