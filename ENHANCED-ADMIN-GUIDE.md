   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ summer-2025/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fall-2025/

   ```

2. **Use descriptive naming**:
   ```
   spring-detox-green.jpg
   summer-tropical-paradise.jpg
   fall-spiced-apple-cider.jpg
   ```

3. **Optimize before upload**:
   - Use [TinyPNG.com](https://tinypng.com) to compress images
   - Resize to exactly 400x300px for products
   - Save as JPG for photos, PNG for graphics

### **For Seasonal Management:**
1. **Create seasonal config backups**:
   - Save each season's `config.json` as `config-spring-2025.json`
   - Easy to restore previous menus

2. **Use the active/inactive toggle** strategically:
   - Keep seasonal products in config but set `active: false`
   - Quick to reactivate when season returns
